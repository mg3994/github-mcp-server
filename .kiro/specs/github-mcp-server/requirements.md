# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implemented in Rust that provides GitHub integration capabilities. The GitHub MCP Server will enable AI assistants to interact with GitHub repositories, issues, pull requests, and other GitHub resources through a standardized MCP interface.

## Glossary

- **MCP Server**: A server implementation that follows the Model Context Protocol specification for AI assistant integration
- **GitHub API**: The REST and GraphQL APIs provided by GitHub for programmatic access to GitHub resources
- **Repository**: A GitHub repository containing source code, documentation, and project files
- **Issue**: A GitHub issue used for tracking bugs, feature requests, or other tasks
- **Pull Request**: A GitHub pull request proposing changes to a repository
- **Authentication Token**: A GitHub personal access token or OAuth token for API authentication
- **Resource**: Any GitHub entity that can be accessed through the API (repositories, issues, PRs, etc.)
- **Tool**: An MCP tool that performs a specific GitHub operation
- **Client**: The AI assistant or application that connects to the MCP server

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using an AI assistant, I want to authenticate with GitHub through the MCP server, so that I can access my repositories and perform GitHub operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Client requests authentication, THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL accept a GitHub personal access token
2. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL validate the authentication token with the GitHub API
3. IF the authentication token is invalid, THEN THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL return an authentication error
4. WHILE authenticated, THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL maintain the authentication state for subsequent requests
5. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL support token-based authentication without requiring OAuth flow

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an AI assistant, I want to list and search GitHub repositories, so that I can help users find and work with their projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to list repositories for the authenticated user
2. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to search repositories by name or description
3. WHEN listing repositories, THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL return repository metadata including name, description, and URL
4. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL support filtering repositories by visibility (public, private)
5. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL handle pagination for large repository lists

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI assistant, I want to read repository contents and file information, so that I can help users understand and work with their code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to read file contents from a repository
2. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to list directory contents in a repository
3. WHEN reading files, THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL support different branches and commit references
4. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL return file metadata including size, type, and last modified date
5. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL handle binary files by returning appropriate metadata without content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an AI assistant, I want to manage GitHub issues, so that I can help users track and organize their project tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to list issues for a repository
2. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to create new issues with title, body, and labels
3. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to update existing issues
4. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to close or reopen issues
5. WHEN listing issues, THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL support filtering by state, labels, and assignee

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI assistant, I want to work with pull requests, so that I can help users manage code reviews and contributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to list pull requests for a repository
2. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to create new pull requests
3. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to review pull request details and changes
4. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide a tool to merge pull requests
5. WHEN listing pull requests, THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL support filtering by state and author

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to handle errors gracefully, so that I can understand and resolve issues when GitHub operations fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub API rate limits are exceeded, THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL return a rate limit error with retry information
2. WHEN network connectivity fails, THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL return a connection error
3. WHEN repository access is denied, THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL return a permission error
4. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL log errors with sufficient detail for debugging
5. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL provide meaningful error messages to the Client

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the MCP server, so that I can customize its behavior for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL support configuration through environment variables
2. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL allow configuration of GitHub API base URL for GitHub Enterprise
3. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL support configurable request timeouts
4. THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL allow configuration of logging levels
5. WHERE custom configuration is provided, THE GitHub_MCP_Server SHALL validate configuration parameters at startup
